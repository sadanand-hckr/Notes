Virtual Box Host-Only setting -> https://code-maven.com/virtualbox-host-only-network-ssh-to-remote-machine

When we r using the metasploit, kalilinux, windows from vm then the connection among them would be a kind of ethernet connection
as they all r connected with the same network NAT network

Kali Linux ->
Username -> root
Password -> toor

Metaspolit ->
Password and username -> msfadmin
to turn of machine -> sudo poweroff

Windows 10 VM ->
Password -> Passw0rd!

Windows 7 VM ->
username/password -> admin7

Windows 2012 Server-> Press Ctrl+del to go to sign in windows
username/passwd -> admin12/Passw0rd!

DVWA ->
Username -> admin
Password -> password

Beef ->
username -> beef1
password -> beef1

Mutillidae ->
username -> demouser1
password -> demouser1

- Already multiple websites r installed in the metasploit which we can exploit

- Make sure that the Kali and Metospolit r connected on the same NAT network and to check it go to ur attacker machine (kali
 linux) and then open the browser and enter the IP address in the URL of browser of victim machine(metasploit), if it is
 connected then the metaspoit is going to open

Note - to fix one config issue in metasploit go to terminal and enter -> nano /var/www/mutilladae/config.inc
